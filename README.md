# Recurring-Co-traveling-Pattern-Detection
The mbr_functions.py provides helper functions for RCPD miners. RCPD_miner.py contains the RCPD and RCPD-Adv algorithms. case_study.py, comparative_analysis.py, sensitivity_analysis.py, and synthetic_data_generation_and_testing.py do the experiments.
The generate_map function in the synthetic_data_generation_and_testing.py generates the synthetic data, saves the data, and plots the data. The Synthetic_data_sample.csv provides a sample of synthetic data for a four-agent co-traveling group. The synthetic data generation and testing are done on the fly.
